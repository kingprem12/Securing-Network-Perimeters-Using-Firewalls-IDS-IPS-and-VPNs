# Securing Network Perimeters Using Firewalls, IDS/IPS, and VPNs

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates how to secure a network perimeter using Firewall, Intrusion Detection and Prevention Systems (IDS/IPS), and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).

The implementation was performed on Kali Linux and includes real-time monitoring and attack detection.

## Tools Used
- Firewall: UFW
- IDS/IPS: Snort
- Traffic Monitoring: Wireshark
- VPN: OpenVPN
- OS: Kali Linux

## Implementation Summary
- Configured firewall rules to block unauthorized access
- Deployed Snort IDS to detect suspicious network activity
- Monitored ICMP and TCP traffic using Wireshark
- Demonstrated secure communication using VPN technology

## Outcome
The project successfully improves network visibility and provides protection against common network-based attacks.
